Pull requests are welcomed and encouraged. Please branch from master, and be sure to include at least a brief summary in the PR thread describing what your PR does and why you think it is useful, or what issue(s) it addresses.

If you find a bug, or have an idea for a feature please create an issue, and we can discuss it there. First, have a quick look through the existing issues to avoid creating a duplicate.
